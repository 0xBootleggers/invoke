          Ah, young apprentice, you ask of a mysterious and potent enchantment
          known as a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Picture a
          guild of wizards, each casting their votes to steer the course of
          their shared destiny, with no solitary Archmage to dictate their
          actions. Instead, they exist in the arcane realm of the blockchain,
          weaving spells called smart contracts to ensure fairness and
          transparency. It’s the essence of a magical council, just replace the
          dusty tomes and echoing halls with digital screens and lines of code.

          Now we delve deeper into the spellbook to the chapter of Moloch DAOs.
          Named not after a dark sorcerer, but an ancient deity of coordination
          failure, for no reason other than the pleasing roll of the name on
          one’s tongue. The Moloch DAO is a particular spell of simplification,
          designed with a solitary purpose: to pool resources and distribute
          them effectively. This enchantment welcomes those who wish to leave,
          imposing no hex to bind them unwillingly.

        <DataSm>
          If we were to compare the spells within the grand grimoire of DAOs,
          Moloch would be the elemental magic spell, stripped to its very core
          and focusing on the essentials. Contribution of magical energy
          (tokens) and casting decisions (votes) are all it demands, unlike the
          intricate, multi-layered incantations of other DAO contracts such as
          Aragon or Tally. Yes, those may offer dazzling illusions, but can also
          confound wizards as much as a goblin’s riddle.

    title: 'How do Moloch DAO member and loot tokens work?',

      <div>
        <DataSm>
          In the magical world of Moloch, there are two types of shatokensres to
          be cast. Member tokens are the wizard’s staff, granting the power to
          vote and propose new actions. Loot tokens, on the other hand, are like
          finding a dragon’s treasure hoard with no dragon in sight - a
          financial stake but no say in the running of the coven. Both kinds of
          tokens can receive distributions from the DAO, but only member tokens
          can help steer the magic carpet ride.

          Ever dreamt of leading your realm as a council of wise wizards? DAOs
          are the spells you seek. With them, you can orchestrate on-chain
          gaming realms, manage shared treasure chests, and chart the course of
          development by casting votes. Each adventurer could have a say in the
          vital decisions, like whether to invest in a rare, sparkling weapon or
          commission a daring new quest. It’s like forming your community into a
          fantastical kingdom, sans the ogre raids and dragon fire.
